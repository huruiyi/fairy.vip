# mac下安装nginx
```yaml
brew install nginx

brew reinstall nginxßßß

Docroot is: /usr/local/var/www

The default port has been set in /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf to 8080 so that nginx can run without sudo.

nginx will load all files in /usr/local/etc/nginx/servers/.

To start nginx:
  brew services start nginx

Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  /usr/local/opt/nginx/bin/nginx -g 'daemon off;'

==> Summary
🍺  /usr/local/Cellar/nginx/1.21.3: 26 files, 2.2MB
